        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Lord Rudra or Shiva is known as Abhishekapriya as he loves Abhisheka or anointment with holy water. Rudra, as mentioned in the Rig Vedas is the most ancient form of Lord Shiva. Maha Rudrabhisheka is the most favourite pooja offered to Lord Shiva. Rudrabhishekam Puja is performed with the prescribed ingredients such as honey, curd ghee and milk with chants on the Sri Rudram. The puja wipes out all sins and purifies the atmosphere. It also removes all sorts of planetary doshams.

            In Rudrabhisheka Pooja, sacred Kalashas are filled with water and the presence of Varuna and holy rivers namely Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Saraswati, Narmada, Sindhu and Kaveri are invoked into the water. With that water alone the Lord will be anointed by chanting the hymns, especially the Rudra Chamaka. The main part of this Pooja is the Rudram which will be chanted throughout. This pooja gives one the full blessing of Lord Shiva.
            
            In Rudrabhisheka Puja Lord Shiva is worshiped in his Rudra form, and it is hailed by all Vedic scriptures as one of the greatest Puja to remove all evils, to attain all desires and for all round prosperity. Rudrabhishekam is particularly performed for the sake of cleansing ones sins and afflictions, for bringing peace, prosperity and happiness, along with the bonding in the family.  Rudrabhishekam is usually performed on ones ‘Janma Nakshatra’.  It is commonly accepted that for any venture to be successful, one must seek the blessings of lord Ganapati hence Maha Ganapati Pooja is performed first without fail.

        <p class="sectionTag text-big"><b>Significance of Maha Rudra</b></p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Sage Satapatha in his treatise ‘Maharnava Karma Vipaka’ listed four types of abhisheka procedures in line with Vedic and scriptural lore.  Abhisheka is the most favourite form of worship for lord Shiva. These are listed as Rudram, Ekadasa Rudram, Maha Rudram and Athi Rudram – each being more powerful than the preceding one. Maha Rudra abhishekam is the most popular among devotees.

            During Maha Rudra, Namaka recited once along with recital of Chamaka one time constitutes one Rudram.
            
            11 recitations of Namakam + 1 Anuvaka of Chamakam is called Ekadasa Rudram i.e. after chanting the Namakam, the first anuvaka of Chamakam is chanted afterwards, then another round of Namakam is chanted followed by the second Anuvaka of Chamakam, and so on until the 11th chanting of Namakam is followed by the 11th Anuvaka of Chamakam.
            
            · 11 rounds of Ekadasa Rudram chanting is one Laghu Rudram
            
            · 11 rounds of Laghu Rudram chanting is one Maha Rudram (1,331 times of chanting)
            
            Every step of the Maha Rudra Maha Homam involves Rudrabisheka for Shiva lingam that immensely pleases the lord.
